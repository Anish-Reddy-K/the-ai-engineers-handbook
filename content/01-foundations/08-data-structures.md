**Data Structures**: Arrays and lists (contiguous memory, O(1) access). Hash tables (key-value mapping, O(1) lookup). Trees (hierarchical data, traversal). Graphs (nodes and edges, adjacency representations).

**Complexity Analysis**: Big-O notation. Time complexity: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n²). Space complexity. Why complexity matters for ML inference at scale. Choosing the right structure for AI/ML pipelines.
