Understanding embeddings: turning text into high-dimensional vectors. Embedding models (OpenAI, Sentence Transformers). **Vector databases**: Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, FAISS, pgvector, Qdrant. **Vector search**: similarity metrics (cosine, dot product), indexing (HNSW, IVF), nearest-neighbor at scale. Use cases: semantic search, recommendations, anomaly detection.
